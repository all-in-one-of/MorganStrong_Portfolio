Code Samples of all kinds - Python, CSS, etc.

**abc2bjson**
A Python Module used for conversion of Alembic files to BJSON sequences using
Houdini.  Created for the BYU 2013 Animation: "Chasm" on H12.1.125 (before 
Mantra natively supported the Alembic format).

**ChasmManager**
A PyQT-based file/asset manager used on the BYU 2013 Animation: "Chasm."
It was designed to be particularly flexible around changes in project location
due to the fact that the whole project had to switch locations with 4 months
left in production.
