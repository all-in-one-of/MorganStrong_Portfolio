Code Samples of all kinds - Python, CSS, etc.

**abc2bjson**
A Python Module used for conversion of Alembic files to BJSON sequences using
Houdini.  Created for the BYU 2013 Animation: "Chasm" on H12.1.125 (before 
Mantra natively supported the Alembic format).

**assetmanager**
A PyQT-based file/asset manager used on the BYU 2013 Animation: "Chasm."
It was designed to be particularly flexible around changes in project location
due to the fact that the whole project had to switch locations with 4 months
left in production. Simple usage documentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15b4WI8D4d6BDSWr9BkZcwCJNbw2ctkp9bzPuXyC0TgA/edit?usp=sharing).

This code has been further developed by continuing students at BYU. The github
repository is available [here](https://github.com/byu-animation/byu-animation-tools).
