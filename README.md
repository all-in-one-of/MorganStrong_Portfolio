*Code Samples of all kinds - Python, CSS, etc.*

**Universal Scene Description**
A robust 3D scene description library with a high-level API for reading and authoring
scenes following a novel layering paradigm developed by Pixar.  I've been working on
this project at Pixar from October 2013 - March 2014.  Although code is currently
unavailable, Pixar is guaging interest and strongly considering making USD open-source
as they did with OpenSubdiv.  For more details, see their website [here](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/).

**abc2bjson**
A Python Module used for conversion of Alembic files to BJSON sequences using
Houdini.  Created for the BYU 2013 Animation: "Chasm" on H12.1.125 (before 
Mantra natively supported the Alembic format).

**assetmanager**
A PyQT-based file/asset manager used on the BYU 2013 Animation: "Chasm."
It was designed to be particularly flexible around changes in project location
due to the fact that the whole project had to switch locations with 4 months
left in production. Simple usage documentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15b4WI8D4d6BDSWr9BkZcwCJNbw2ctkp9bzPuXyC0TgA/edit?usp=sharing).

This code has been further developed by continuing students at BYU. The github
repository is available [here](https://github.com/byu-animation/byu-animation-tools).

**hackermeter**
These are semi-trivial coding projects done on hackermeter.com.

**CSS**
I am unable to post any of my web-development code at this time due to agreements
with previous employers, but you can get a feel for the type/quality of work that
I was assigned to do by viewing their website at [Qualtrics.com](http://www.qualtrics.com).
Most work has been WordPress-based, but I've also interacted with Blogger, Tumblr, 
and several other content management systems and templates.  You can also view my
website at [fxetc.wordpress.com](http://fxetc.wordpress.com).

**Gists**
Please have a look at my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/rIZenAShes) for further (and often
more recent) examples of my code.


*NOTE: The abc2bjson and assetmanager projects are collaborations with fellow coworkers/students and the code should not be regarded as exclusively mine.*
